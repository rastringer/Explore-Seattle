XXXX uses natural language processing to discern a user's request to help find events and activities in Seattle. The app draws data from the Eventful, Eventbrite and Meetup website APIs.

Technology

Four colleagues wrote the app over a week using the Meteor framework. We used the ewall:foundation port for front-end design, and XXXX for testing.

Language processing

We wrote an information extraction algorithm to categorize data from the APIs and, on the front-end, determines which categories of events and activities most suit the user based on their input.
